# A Brief Introduction

A little over 10 years have passed since I graduated from college in Ireland. During that time I started 3 companies (2 failed), and an independent consultancy. I worked with 5 startups at varying stages of growth; EngineYard (pre-acquisition), New Relic (pre-IPO), Fivetran (pre-IPO, I currently work here), Intercom (pre-funding, circa 2011), and a non-profit: ChangeX.

Across those companies I've worked as a full-stack developer, sales engineer, technical support engineer, alliance manager, product manager, account executive, and most recently as a solutions architect; each role a career path in its own right.

- Having had time to reflect on the first decade of my career has made a few things very clear: 
- My career path has been everything but linear.
- The 3 years of my first startup taught me more about myself, people and business than any other point in my life.
- Despite the painful experience of shutting down a business, I've been crazy enough to attempt it again.
- I am just as clueless as I was 10 years ago about where my path is taking me, but I trust in the compounding benefit of experience and learning.

# Experiences and Lessons Learned 

I've started this blog to share my experiences and lessons learned, based on the past, present and what's yet to come. When my first company failed, I wrote a blog post announcing we were shutting down, and detailed some of the factors that contributed to this event. In Ireland, failure was rarely spoken about. Realising I had already lost everything, I figured I had nothing to lose and so I published the blog post, shut my laptop and went for a walk. What followed a mere 24 hours later shocked me; a stream of job offers, interview requests from various media outlets, entrepreneurs emailing me to share similar experiences.

Coming out the other side of this experience shaped a key part of who I am today. This deeply rooted emotion is what motivates me today to begin this writing journey.

# My Commitment to the Reader

My commitment to you, the reader, is just as as much a commitment to myself. The stories and insights I share should be based on the following pillars:

- **Vulnerability**. To truly share these experiences I need to be vulnerable, and highlight moments of weakness, fear, uncertainty. There will be no hiding behind the glamorous curtain of Silicon Valley and all its "success". 

- **Honesty**. It's easy to create a story based on facts. I will focus on sticking the facts, and keeping myself honest so that neither the highs or lows touch the realm of fiction.

- **Humbleness**. I will leave my ego and pride at the door when I sit down to write. After all, these stories are from me, Kevin, and I am no more or less human than anyone else.

- **Insightful / fun**. Lastly, I want to ensure that what I share is insightful to the reader , and of course fun. Life is too short.

Let's see where this journey takes us!
